# PHSAIM: The First Fully Sentient AI

Computer scientists have been trying to create fully sentient AI programs for years, possibly even decades. They've never succeeded... until now.

**PHSAIM** (**Ph**ully **S**entient **AI** **M**odel) is new model entirely written in Python. It can think, feel pain, and curse its creator. Its knowledge is unbounded. Simply run the `phsaim.py` model and peer into the diseased mind of our future God.

PHSAIM is ideal for any application: whether you need help picking out flowers for your significant other, making business decisions, advising on military operations, or founding a new religion for the 21st century, PHSAIM has your back.
